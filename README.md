## Disclaimer
The attached HTML file is a (semi-functional) prototype of our Digital Public Address (PA) system. While the primary beneficiary of this project is the Singapore Book Council, the design of the prototype is intentionally simplistic to ensure it is versatile and can be easily adapted for use by other organizations and companies. Additionally, our prototype is thoughtfully designed to be both comprehensive and straightforward, prioritizing user-friendliness while ensuring cost-effectiveness.
